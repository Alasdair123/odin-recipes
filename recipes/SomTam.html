    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Som tam is a Thai papaya salad. Don't confuse Thai salads with the boring leafy salads the rest of the world enjoys. Like most Thai food, som tam teases the taste buds with its sweet, spicy, salty and sour elements.

        Som Tam is served in restaurants and by vendors at street markets all over Thailand. Each region has a different version of the savoury dish, so be sure to order som tam in every city you visit.
        
        Many vendors will prepare som tam in front of you. Don't be afraid to ask the chef to use mild peppers. Not everyone's palate is accustomed to the signature spiciness of Thai food.</p>
    
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 ½ cups julienned green papaya</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Thai chilies, to taste </li>
        <li>1 ½ Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped, packed</li>
        <li>2-3 long beans, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon small dried shrimp</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tsp tamarind juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ Tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup grape tomato halves</li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as little water on the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.</li>
            <li> In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).</li>
            <li> Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet paste and all the chunks are dissolved</li>
            <li> Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.</li>
            <li> Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly.</li>
            <li> Add fish sauce, tamarind juice, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime skin into the mortar as well for extra lime fragrance. Stir with a large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.</li>
            <li> Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip method as shown in the video @8:40. Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes are just slightly crushed, it's done!</li>
            <li> Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts </li>
        </ol>
